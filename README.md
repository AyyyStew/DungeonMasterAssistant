# Welcome to the Dungeon Master Assistant Repo

This is a tool designed to help run tabletop roleplaying games like Dungeons and Dragons, Warhammer 40k: Imperium Malidictum, Pathfinder, and more.

This tool was created to act as a dice roller and initiave tracker for most systems.

## Rationale

This is a personal project I created after I kept forgetting initiatve turn orders while running a Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy Game.

This project was created to run on computers with limited resources. The old hardware I run my DND games on would overheat using other trackers so this was built as a less resource intensive version of those.

## Improvement Ideas

There are several more features I want to implment when the time and need arises:

- Status Tracker - to keep track of whose posioned, on fire, or environemntal conditions
- Custom Dice Calculator - to implemnt 'd' as a operator like + - / \*
- Non Character Entities - to allow for enivroment hazards or times
- Customer Characters - to store character's stats and inventories
- Character and Enitty Storage - To save time inputing data
- Character, Entity, and Enviromental Hazard Library - For quick use
- Encounter timeline - to visualize encounters and keep history

# How to Setup and Run the Code

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
